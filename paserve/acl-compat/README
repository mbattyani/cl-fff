acl-compat is a library that implements parts of the Allegro Common
Lisp (ACL) API for areas that are not covered by the ANSI Common Lisp
standard itself (e.g. sockets, threading).  The motivation for
creating and maintaining acl-compat is to get the web server
AllegroServe (that was released by Franz Inc under the LLGPL) running
on a wide range of Lisp implementations, with as few source changes to
its core code as possible.

acl-compat names its packages by prepending the corresponding ACL
package name with the string "ACL-COMPAT.".  For example, the ACL
threading API symbols are exported from the package ACL-COMPAT.MP.
Ideally, ACL-specific code could run on any supported Lisp
implementation only by changing package references.  

Of course, the present situation is not ideal.  :( Functionality is
only implemented on an as-needed basis, implemented functions don't
handle all argument combinations properly, etc.  On the other hand,
enough is implemented to support a web and application server that
exercises a wide range of functionality (client and server sockets,
threading, etc.).


To load acl-compat:

- install asdf (see < http://www.cliki.net/asdf >) and make sure it's
  loaded.

- load acl-compat.asd

- evaluate (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :acl-compat)
