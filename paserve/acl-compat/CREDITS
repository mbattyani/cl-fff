CREDITS; a.k.a. the history of Portable AllegroServe

This was written by Rudi Schlatte, who (knowing himself) is sure he
forgot some important contributors.  Please mail me (rudi at
constantly.at) to point out any inconsistencies, don't be shy!

* Corman Lisp

The code that started it all.  Chris Double took Allegro's
open-sourced code, got it to run on Corman Lisp and released the
code..  After Portable AllegroServe got off the ground, he re-arranged
his port so that it fit in the structure of acl-compat.

* Xanalys LispWorks

Jochen Schmidt ported Chris Double's AllegroServe port to LispWorks,
laid the groundwork for the "Portable" part of paserve and started
the SourceForge project.

* cmucl

cmucl was the third Lisp implementation to run Portable
AllegroServe.  The port was done by Rudi Schlatte during his military
service out of sheer boredom.

* Digitool MCL 

John DeSoi contributed this port and kept it working when the antics
of other developers broke his code once again.

* OpenMCL

Also done by John DeSoi.  Gary Byers himself later contributed code to
support OpenMCL's OS-level threads (OpenMCL version 14 and up) in an
efficient way.

* sbcl

This port was done by Rudi Schlatte, using Daniel Barlow's sbcl
multiprocessing code in the McCLIM GUI project as inspiration.

* clisp

Also by Rudi Schlatte.  Since clisp has no support for threads,
neither does acl-compat on this platform.  Code can still be
compiled, however.

* Scieneer Common Lisp

This port was contributed by Douglas Crosher.

* Allegro Common Lisp

It may seem strange to implement an API on top of itself, but Kevin
Rosenberg's implementation makes it possible to run systems that use
acl-compat on ACL itself without source changes.
